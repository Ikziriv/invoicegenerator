This open source project is made to show my knowledge about JavaScript and Frontend Development 🤓

You can see the live project [here](https://invoicegenerator.now.sh) 🚀

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Install dependencies.**

    ```shell
    cd invoicegenerator/

    npm i
    ```

2.  **Using commands.**

    ```shell
    npm run start:dev # Start development server

    npm run start # Start production server

    npm run lint:js # Linter for JavaScript

    npm run lint:styles # Linter for styles

    npm run lint:html # Linter for HTML includir a11y

    npm run build # Build the project
    ```

## What we use? 🧐

🖥 For the CSS i use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), i extremely recommend you to use this utility framework; it's going to help you to optimize your development time like 10x more faster

🕹 For the animation of the dropdown i use [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) that is a reactive and declarative library with the nature of big frameworks like Vue or React at a much lower cost

🇺🇸 For the internationalization i use [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) that is a **framework** written in and for JavaScript to use different languages in your code

💭 For the tooltips i use [Tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/) that is a lightweight library to make tooltips and popovers more faster than you think

**Let's go and help open source projects** 😎
